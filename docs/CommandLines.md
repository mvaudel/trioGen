## Functionalities and associated command lines

Multiple functionalities are implemented in TrioGen, each coming with its own command line.

- [_LinearModel_](cli/LinearModel.md): Runs {child, mother, father} trio linear models genome-wide or one specific regions of the genome.
- [_Extract_](cli/Extract.md): Extracts results for specific phenotypes or variants from the _LinearModel_ command line.
- [_LdMatrix_](cli/LdMatrix.md): Computes an LD matrix from unrelated samples in trio data.
- [_LdPruning_](cli/LdPruning.md): Performs LD pruning on association results.
- [_LdValue_](cli/LdValue.md): Returns the variants in LD with a given list of variants.
- [_LocusZoom_](cli/LocusZoom.md): Extracts the data necessary to plot locus zoom plots.
- [_MendelianCheck_](cli/MendelianCheck.md): Writes a report on mendelian errors in a given data set.
- [_PRS_](cli/PRS.md): Computes trio polygenic risk scores.
- [_SimpleScore_](cli/SimpleScore.md): Computes simple risk scores based on a list of weights.
- [_VariantData_](cli/VariantData.md): Exports a matrix of standardized trio genotypes and phenotypes for a set of variants.
- [_VariantFile_](cli/VariantFile.md): Builds a variant file from a list of variant ids.
- [_VcfToBgen_](cli/VcfToBgen.md): Exports the phased genotypes of trios from a vcf to a phased v1.3 bgen file.
