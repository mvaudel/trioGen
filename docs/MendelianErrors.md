## Mendelian errors

For a given variant, the share of Mendelian errors is estimated using trios presenting a homozygous parent. Then, a Mendelian error results in a value of -1 or +2 in the non-transmitted allele count. The share of Mendelian error is estimated by comparing the number of such erroneous genotypes to the number of trios with a homozygous parent expected from the tested allele frequency. 

When the estimated share of Mendelian errors is over 50%, the alleles of the children are swapped. 

A substantial share of Mendelian errors (few percents) indicate poor phasing accuracy. A share of Mendelian errors close to 50 % indicate no phasing, then trio models are not affected but haplotype models cannot distinguish the maternal- from the paternal-transmitted alleles.
