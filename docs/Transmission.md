## Allele Transmission

The allele transmission from parent to child is inferred from the phased children genotypes. For chromosomes 1 to 22, two alleles are expected, one from the mother and one from the father, in that order. For the X/23 chromosome, one maternal allele is expected for males, and one from the mother and one from the father for females, in that order. If you need other transmission schemes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mvaudel/trioGen/issues).
